# interview

This was a research project by Emil about p5.js in 2019

..

ES: **Tell me a bit about your background what's your area of work or study?**

RA: I have a background in architecture but I'm currently a
programmer/developer but the architecture stuff keeps pulling
me into design and code and making graphics stuff mainly with
the use of repetition, recursion and the tools available to do that
graphically.

ES: **Is it more front-end or back-end programming that you do?**

RA: The strict stuff that I do is more backend but the flip side is that I
like to use presentation stuff like OpenGL or whatever it is to
show not just text but an image.

ES: **but mainly day to day it is more programming, not graphics as much?**

RA: I try to do both but mostly the graphics is in my spare time.
